**SQL**

Master the basics of querying tables in relational databases such as MySQL, SQL Server, and PostgreSQL.

Joining data in SQL (DataCamp)
In this course, you'll learn all about the power of joining tables while exploring interesting features of countries and their cities throughout the world. You will master inner and outer joins, as well as self joins, semi joins, anti joins and cross joins—fundamental tools in any PostgreSQL wizard's toolbox. Never fear set theory again after learning all about unions, intersections, and except clauses through easy-to-understand diagrams and examples. Lastly, you'll be introduced to the challenging topic of subqueries. You will be able to visually grasp these ideas by using Venn diagrams and other linking illustrations.

Intermediate SQL (DataCamp)
This intermediate-level course will teach you several key functions necessary to wrangle, filter, and categorize information in a relational database, expand your SQL toolkit, and answer complex questions. You will learn the robust use of CASE statements, subqueries, and window functions—all while discovering some interesting facts about soccer using the European Soccer Database.
